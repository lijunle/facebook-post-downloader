# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 23, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the **Facebook Post Downloader** browser extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your data remains secure and under your control.

## Data Collection and Usage

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.**

- **No Personal Information:** We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information.
- **No Facebook Data:** We do not collect, store, or transmit your Facebook posts, messages, friends list, or login credentials. All processing of your data occurs locally on your device.
- **No Tracking:** We do not track your browsing history, usage patterns, or analytics.

## How It Works

The extension operates entirely **client-side** (within your browser). When you visit Facebook, the extension interacts directly with the website to:

1.  Identify available posts.
2.  Add download buttons to posts.
3.  Allow you to download them as files (images, videos, text).

Your Facebook session and data never leave your browser and are never sent to our servers or any third parties.

## Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions to function:

- **`downloads`:** Required to save the downloaded posts (images, videos, text) to your device.
- **Host Permissions:** Required to allow the extension to interact with Facebook pages to find posts and add download buttons.

## Third-Party Services

The extension interacts directly with Facebook. It does not route your traffic through any intermediate servers. We do not share your data with any third-party services, advertisers, or analytics providers.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted on this page.
