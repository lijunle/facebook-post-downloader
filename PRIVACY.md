# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 30, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the **Facebook Post Downloader** browser extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about what data we collect.

## Data Collection and Usage

### Personal Information

**We do not collect any personally identifiable information.**

- **No Personal Information:** We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information.
- **No Facebook Data:** We do not collect, store, or transmit your Facebook posts, messages, friends list, or login credentials. All processing of your Facebook data occurs locally on your device.

### Anonymous Usage Analytics

We collect **anonymous usage analytics** through Microsoft Application Insights to help us understand how the extension is used and to improve its functionality. This data includes:

- **Event names:** Such as when the extension dialog is opened/closed, when downloads are initiated, or when buttons are clicked.
- **Aggregate counts:** Such as the number of stories visible, the number of downloads in progress, or the number of items selected.

**What we do NOT collect:**

- Any content from your Facebook posts (text, images, videos)
- Your Facebook account information or credentials
- URLs or identifiers of specific posts
- Any information that could identify you personally

All analytics data is anonymous and cannot be used to identify individual users.

## How It Works

The extension operates primarily **client-side** (within your browser). When you visit Facebook, the extension interacts directly with the website to:

1.  Identify available posts.
2.  Add download buttons to posts.
3.  Allow you to download them as files (images, videos, text).

Your Facebook session and data never leave your browser and are never sent to our servers or any third parties.

## Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions to function:

- **`downloads`:** Required to save the downloaded posts (images, videos, text) to your device.
- **Host Permissions:** Required to allow the extension to interact with Facebook pages to find posts and add download buttons.

## Third-Party Services

- **Facebook:** The extension interacts directly with Facebook. It does not route your traffic through any intermediate servers.
- **Microsoft Application Insights:** We use this service to collect anonymous usage analytics as described above. For more information, see [Microsoft's Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement).

We do not share your data with any other third-party services, advertisers, or analytics providers.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.
